# my-learning-website
It's a static website made to show my abilities in organising the knowledge i have in CSS and HTML.
With its simple and clean interface the demo which i have created, could serve as a real learning website.
The idea and the purpose of this website is simply to show my abilities in building and designing using simple HTML and 
css(Flexbox).
I was inspired by a project in FIGMA using a plugin called humaaans.
